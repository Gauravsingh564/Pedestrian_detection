# Pedestrian_detection

Pedestrian detection using YOLOv9 and DeepSORT enables real-time tracking from video streams with high accuracy and efficiency. YOLOv9 (You Only Look Once version 9) is a state-of-the-art object detection model that provides fast and precise pedestrian detection. DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracker with Deep Learning) enhances tracking by associating detected pedestrians across frames using deep learning-based appearance matching and Kalman filtering. Together, these technologies ensure robust, real-time tracking of multiple pedestrians in crowded environments. This approach is widely used in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and autonomous systems, improving safety and efficiency in various real-world applications.
